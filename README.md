I’m Venkata Sowjanya Koka, a Data Analytics and Information Systems graduate student.

I received my undergraduate degree(Bachelor of Technology) in Electronics and Communication engineering where I got introduced to databases and programming. 
Having started coding at an early age and also having completed my Bachelor’s, I can say my interest in this field has only grown with time. 

I gravitate more towards Data Science and Data Analysis. My journey to higher education started with a goal to extend my knowledge related to data and its importance in driving a business towards success.

As businesses today are becoming more inextricably linked with information technology, I strive to utilize my expertise to bridge the gap between technology and business.
My key interest lies solely in learning and developing my skills in analyzing data using various emerging tools and techniques and sharing my technical expertise with people. 
I thoroughly enjoy tackling problems pertaining to technology and coming up with novel ideas. 

_I also believe in the ideology **"Future belongs to the ones who are not afraid to try it, explore it and question it"** which enables me to focus on not only continuous improvement, but also innovation._
