# <p align="center">👋 Hi, there! 😃


I’m Venkata Sowjanya Koka, a Data Analytics and Information Systems graduate student.

I received my undergraduate degree(Bachelor of Technology) in Electronics and Communication engineering where I got introduced to databases and programming. 
Having started coding at an early age and also having completed my Bachelor’s, I can say my interest in this field has only grown with time. 

I gravitate more towards Data Science and Data Analysis. My journey to higher education started with a goal to extend my knowledge related to data and its importance in driving a business towards success.

I have always enjoyed solving puzzles. So that’s how I look at big data sets. Data is one big puzzle I want to solve. Finding patterns nobody else sees is a challenge to me.

My key interest lies solely in learning and developing my skills in analyzing data using various emerging tools and techniques. I thoroughly enjoy tackling problems and coming up with novel ideas. 

_I also believe in the ideology **"Future belongs to the ones who are not afraid to try it, explore it and question it"** which enables me to focus on not only continuous improvement, but also innovation._
